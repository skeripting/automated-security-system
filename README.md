> A security system for the Dragon12 Board Microcontroller

# Automated Security System

This is a project that I designed and developed with a teammate for a microcontrollers class in community college. This program runs on the Dragonboard 12 microcontroller.

## Disclaimer
This project relied on a RFID12 module created by professor Bruce Link, which I unfortunately don't have access to anymore.
